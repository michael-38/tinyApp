# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly)

This was an introductory project to familiarize with the components of a full stack application:
  - HTTP transactions
  - Login/Registration
  - Hashed passwords
  - Encrypted cookies
  - User-specific features

The application is fully functional, design to be revised in the near future.
